## ⚠️ Usage Flow Examples

### ✅ Correct Flow

```
User: Please help me create tests for CreateUserValidator

AI: I notice you need to test a Validator. According to the quick reference table,
    I should load the dotnet-testing-fluentvalidation-testing skill.

    [Use Skill tool to load sub-skill]

AI: Now following the FluentValidation Testing skill guidelines to create tests for you...
```

### ❌ Incorrect Flow

```
User: Please help me create tests for CreateUserValidator

AI: Okay, let me write the tests... (start writing code directly without loading sub-skills)
```

## Applicable Scenarios

When you encounter the following situations, I will help you find the correct skills:

- Just starting to learn .NET testing, don't know where to begin
- Want to create tests for existing projects, need complete guidance
- Need to improve test quality, looking for best practices
- Encounter specific testing scenarios, unsure which tool to use
- Want to learn about test data generation, assertions, mocking, and other technologies
- Hope to improve test readability and maintainability
- Need to handle special testing scenarios like time, file systems, etc.

## Quick Decision Tree

### Where Should I Start?

#### Scenario 1: Complete Beginner, Never Written Tests Before

**Recommended Learning Path**:
1. `dotnet-testing-unit-test-fundamentals` - Understand FIRST principles and 3A Pattern
2. `dotnet-testing-test-naming-conventions` - Learn naming conventions
3. `dotnet-testing-xunit-project-setup` - Create your first test project

**Why This Path**:
- FIRST principles are the foundation of all tests, establish correct concepts first
- Naming conventions make tests readable and maintainable
- Hands-on project creation transforms theory into practice

---

#### Scenario 2: Can Write Basic Tests, But Test Data Preparation Is Troublesome

**Recommended Skills (Choose One or Combine)**:

**Option A - Automation First**
→ `dotnet-testing-autofixture-basics`
Suitable: Need large amounts of test data, reduce boilerplate code

**Option B - Realistic Data First**
→ `dotnet-testing-bogus-fake-data`
Suitable: Need realistic test data (names, addresses, emails, etc.)

**Option C - Semantic Clarity First**
→ `dotnet-testing-test-data-builder-pattern`
Suitable: Need high readability, clear expression of test intent

**Option D - Best of Both**
→ `dotnet-testing-autofixture-basics` + `dotnet-testing-autofixture-bogus-integration`
Suitable: Need both automation and realistic data

---

#### Scenario 3: Have External Dependencies (Database, API, Third-party Services) Need to Mock

**Recommended Skill Combination**:
1. `dotnet-testing-nsubstitute-mocking` - NSubstitute Mock framework fundamentals
2. `dotnet-testing-autofixture-nsubstitute-integration` - (Optional) Integrate AutoFixture with NSubstitute

**When Is the Second Skill Needed**:
- If you are already using AutoFixture to generate test data
- Want to automatically create Mock objects, reduce manual configuration

---

#### Scenario 4: Special Scenarios in Testing

**Time-related Testing**
→ `dotnet-testing-datetime-testing-timeprovider`
Handles: DateTime.Now, timezone conversion, time calculations

**File System Testing**
→ `dotnet-testing-filesystem-testing-abstractions`
Handles: File read/write, directory operations, path handling

**Private/Internal Member Testing**
→ `dotnet-testing-private-internal-testing`
Handles: Need to test private, internal members (but use cautiously)

---

#### Scenario 5: Need Better Assertion Methods

**Basic Needs - Fluent Assertions**
→ `dotnet-testing-awesome-assertions-guide`
Should be used by all projects to improve test readability

**Advanced Needs - Complex Object Comparison**
→ `dotnet-testing-complex-object-comparison`
Handles: Deep object comparison, DTO validation, Entity comparison

**Validation Rule Testing**
→ `dotnet-testing-fluentvalidation-testing`
Handles: Testing FluentValidation validators

---

#### Scenario 6: Want to Learn About Test Coverage

→ `dotnet-testing-code-coverage-analysis`
Learn: Use Coverlet to analyze code coverage, generate reports
