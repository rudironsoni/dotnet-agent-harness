# Code Coverage Analysis Guide

## Applicable Scenarios

Use this skill when asked to perform the following tasks:

- Configure and execute code coverage analysis
- Configure Coverlet or other coverage tools
- Generate and interpret coverage reports
- View coverage in Visual Studio or VS Code
- Evaluate test completeness and quality
- Combine complexity metrics to formulate testing strategies

## Code Coverage Core Concepts

### Definition

**Code Coverage** is a measurement metric used to count how much code is actually executed during test execution.

### Correct Understanding

**Actual Value of Code Coverage:**

1. **Find Testing Blind Spots**: Quickly identify code not tested
2. **Evaluate Test Completeness**: Check if important logic is tested
3. **Assist Refactoring Decisions**: Understand which areas need more attention
4. **Increase Testing Confidence**: Confirm critical paths are validated

### Common Misconceptions (Must Avoid)

❌ **Wrong Understanding:**

- 100% coverage means no bugs
- Higher coverage numbers are always better
- Can use coverage as KPI

✅ **Correct Understanding:**

- Code coverage is just a reminder tool, telling you which code is not tested
- **Focus on test effectiveness, not coverage numbers**
- Helps determine if more test cases are needed
- **Should never be used as KPI**

> ⚠️ **Warning**: When Code Coverage is used as KPI, developers write tests without Asserts just to boost numbers, completely losing the meaning of testing.

## .NET Project Coverage Tool Selection

   - **Test Coverage** view: Tree structure
   - **Editor display**: Green/red marking
   - **File Explorer**: Percentage display

## Configuring Coverlet

### Configuring in csproj

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <!-- Test framework packages -->
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.9.3" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="3.0.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="17.12.0" />
    
    <!-- Coverage collector -->
    <PackageReference Include="coverlet.collector" Version="6.0.3">
      <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

### Using runsettings File

See `templates/runsettings-template.xml` file for advanced coverage configuration:

- Exclude specific files or namespaces
- Set coverage thresholds
- Custom report formats

**Usage:**

```powershell
dotnet test --settings coverage.runsettings
```

## Interpreting Coverage Reports

### Color Marking Explanation

In code editor:

- **Green**: Covered by tests
- **Yellow**: Partially covered (some branches not tested)
- **Red**: Not covered

### Coverage Metrics

1. **Line Coverage**
   - Executed code lines / Total code lines
   - Most basic metric

2. **Branch Coverage**
   - Executed branches / Total branches
   - More accurate than line coverage
   - Ensures all branches like if/else, switch are tested

3. **Method Coverage**
   - Executed methods / Total methods

### Report Interpretation Strategy

1. **Prioritize Red Areas**
   - Code completely not tested
   - May be critical business logic

2. **Check Yellow Areas**
   - Confirm all conditional branches are tested
   - Pay special attention to if/else, try/catch, etc.

3. **Evaluate Necessity**
   - Simple getters/setters may not need testing
   - Auto-generated code can be excluded
   - Focus on business logic and complex calculations

## Combining Complexity Metrics

### Cyclomatic Complexity

**Definition:**
Number of independent logic paths in code

**Relationship with Test Cases:**

- Cyclomatic complexity = Minimum number of test cases needed
- Each if, for, while, case, &&, || increases complexity

**Example:**

```csharp
public int Max(int[] array)
{
    if (array == null || array.Length == 0)  // +2 (null check + length check)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException("array must not be empty.");
    }

    int max = array[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < array.Length; i++)  // +1 (loop)
    {
        if (array[i] > max)  // +1 (condition check)
        {
            max = array[i];
        }
    }

    return max;  // +1 (method itself)
}
// Total complexity = 5
```

**Testing Strategy:**

Cyclomatic complexity is 5, need at least 5 test cases:

1. Pass null → Test `array == null`
2. Pass empty array → Test `array.Length == 0`
3. Single element → Doesn't enter loop
4. Max at beginning → Loop doesn't update max
5. Max in middle → Loop updates max

### Visual Studio Extensions

**CodeMaintainability:**

- Display maintainability metrics
- Calculate cyclomatic complexity
- Evaluate code quality

**CodeMaid:**

- Spade feature: Visualize code structure
- Display complexity of each method
- Help identify code needing refactoring

## Improving Coverage Strategy

### 1. Gradual Improvement

```text
Current coverage → Identify key modules → Supplement tests → Reach target value → Continuous monitoring
```

**Recommended Process:**

1. **Phase 1**: Cover core business logic (target 60-70%)
2. **Phase 2**: Supplement boundary condition tests (target 70-80%)
3. **Phase 3**: Handle exception scenarios (target 80-85%)
4. **Maintenance Phase**: New features must have tests

### 2. Priority Ranking

**High Priority (Must Test):**

- Business logic core
- Financial calculations
- Data validation
- Permission control
- Exception handling

**Medium Priority (Recommended to Test):**

- Data transformation
- Formatting logic
- Query logic

**Low Priority (Optional Testing):**

- Simple getters/setters
- DTO classes
- Auto-generated code

### 3. Exclude Unnecessary Code

Exclude in code or runsettings:

```csharp
// Use attribute to exclude
[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
public class GeneratedCode
{
    // ...
}
```

## Practical Recommendations and Best Practices

### Test Case Quantity Decision

1. **Based on Requirement Analysis**
   - List method use cases
   - Identify boundary conditions and exception cases
   - Consider various scenarios of business logic

2. **Reference Complexity Metrics**
   - Cyclomatic complexity provides test case lower bound
   - High complexity methods need more tests
   - Consider refactoring to reduce complexity

3. **Balance Coverage and Quality**
   - Don't use 100% coverage as sole target
   - Focus on critical business logic
   - Ensure actual value of tests

### Testing Strategy

**Four Test Types:**

1. **Boundary Testing**: Test upper and lower limits of input values
2. **Exception Testing**: Verify error handling logic
3. **Main Flow Testing**: Cover normal business processes
4. **Condition Branch Testing**: Ensure all branches are tested

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Review Reports**
   - Check coverage changes before each commit
   - Review coverage during Pull Request

2. **Identify Risk Areas**
   - Focus on uncovered critical code
   - Prioritize high complexity untested areas

3. **Gradual Improvement**
   - Gradually improve test coverage of important modules
   - New features must include tests

4. **Team Collaboration**
   - Establish testing standards and processes
   - Code Review includes test checks

## CI/CD Integration

Coverage analysis can be integrated into CI/CD Pipeline, use `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` in GitHub Actions with `reportgenerator` to generate reports; in Azure DevOps use `DotNetCoreCLI@2` task with `PublishCodeCoverageResults@1`.
